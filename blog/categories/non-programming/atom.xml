<p>That’s right, it’s the Atlanta Braves. Not satisfied with their
<a href="http://realultimateprogramming.blogspot.com/2009/01/i-know-it-was-you-bravos-you-broke-my.html">classless treatment of John Smoltz</a>, now the Braves have
treated <em>another</em> future Hall-of-Famer shabbily by misleading Tom
Glavine about his chances to make the big league club then releasing him
to avoid paying him his roster bonus.</p>

The Atlanta Braves have opted to let John Smoltz
<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3819298">go to the Red Sox</a>.
The face of the franchise, a man who altered his career multiple times
to help the team, who took hometown discounts, and who pitched through
pain to help them win, has gone to another team because the organization
didn’t think he was worth a $5.5 million flyer. This from the same
organization that just made a contract offer to Mike Hampton! John
Smoltz deserved better; he <strong>earned</strong> better. As an organization that
has always prided itself on doing things The Right Way™, the Braves
should <em>be</em> better. I can’t remember ever being ashamed of the Braves in
my entire life… until now.</p>
